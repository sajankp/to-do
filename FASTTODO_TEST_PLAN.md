# FastTodo Comprehensive QA & Feature Validation Plan

This document serves as a detailed checklist for systematically testing and understanding the FastTodo application, its API endpoints, and feature contracts. Use this as your primary reference when running manual or automated QA, validating PRs, or preparing new releases.

***

## 1. Authentication & User Management

- Register user (POST /user)
  - Test registration, handle duplicates.
- Login (POST /token) with valid/invalid credentials.
  - Verify JWT issuance, refresh logic, failure modes for bad input.
- Retrieve profile (GET /user/me).
  - Check info, access control via JWT.
- (If present) Test password reset, update, and deletion endpoints.

## 2. Todo CRUD Operations

- Create todo (POST /todo/) with valid/invalid sets.
- Get todo by ID (GET /todo/{id}), check not found/forbidden behavior.
- List todos (GET /todo/), ensure new items appear instantly.
- Update todo (PUT /todo/{id}), test all update scenarios.
- Delete todo (DELETE /todo/{id}), confirm hard delete, check double delete.

## 3. Priority, Filtering, and Sorting

- Create todos with all priority types.
- Test list filtering/sorting by priority if supported.
- Check grouping and default ordering logic.

## 4. Authorization & Access Control

- Attempt all endpoints as unauthenticated user.
- Cross-user access attempts (if multiuser), check isolation.
- Ensure privacy: one userâ€™s todos hidden from others.

## 5. Edge Cases & Error Handling

- Submit malformed JSON, missing fields, invalid types.
- Enter edge-case dates, large/special char descriptions.
- Review clarity and correctness of all error messages.

## 6. Security Checks

- Brute-force login attempt simulation.
- Attempt SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS, token replay.
- Observe password handling in all flows.
- Check access/refresh token scopes, expiry, invalidation.

## 7. System & API Health

- Check root (GET /) and /health endpoints for uptime/status.
- Validate response payloads and error when unhealthy.

## 8. Pagination & Performance

- Generate enough todos to test pagination.
- Evaluate performance, measure latency on large lists.
- Examine page navigation and limits.

## 9. Environment & DevOps

- Execute tests locally and via Docker.
- Validate .env and secret management.
- Run pytest locally and verify CI/CD status on PR.

## 10. Documentation & Developer Experience

- Review Swagger/OpenAPI docs for endpoint completeness.
- Confirm API documentation matches implementation.

## 11. Advanced/Planned Features

- Rate limiting and behavior under stress.
- Test advanced auth (2FA/OAuth) when present.
- Service layer patterns, caching, async DB.
- Monitoring endpoints, structured logging, AI enhancements.
